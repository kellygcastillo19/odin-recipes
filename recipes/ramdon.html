            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Ram-don (or ramdon) is a slurpable instant noodle dish that is super savory with a spicy kick. This dish gets an upgrade from Korean comfort food to head of the class with the addition of seared cubes of steak.</p>
            
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 package Chapagetti (instant jajangmyeon noodles made by Nongshim)</li>
                    <li>1 package Neoguri (instant jjampong noodles made by Nongshim)</li>
                    <li>8 ounces sirloin, strip, or rib-eye steak preferably well-marbled, cut into ½-to-¾-inch cubes</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 to 3 teaspoons vegetable oil (or oil spray)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan or medium pot. Add the noodles and vegetable mix from the noodle packets, and boil for about 2 to 3 minutes until barely al dente (it will cook more later). Strain the noodles into a strainer set over a large measuring cup or bowl. Reserve 1 cup of starchy water.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile season the cubed beef with salt and pepper. Heat the oil over high heat in a skillet. Add the beef, and sear for about 1 to 2 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Remove from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Return the large saucepan or medium pot used to cook the noodles to medium heat, add the reserved water, the strained noodles/veggies, all the black bean paste seasoning powder from the Chapagetti, ½ (or more to taste--it's spicy!) of the spicy seasoning powder from the Neoguri, and the cooked beef.</li>
                    <li>Stir for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is incorporated and starting to thicken. Remove from the heat and stir in the seasoning oil from the Chapagetti.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to individual bowls and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
