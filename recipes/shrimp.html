            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Juicy prawns cooked in a garlicky buttery sauce, just like the ones you would find served from the shrimp trucks in Hawaii.</p>
            
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound of jumbo shrimp with shell on (cleaned and deveined)</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons of all purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>18 large garlic cloves minced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
                    <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>Fresh chopped parsley (optional for garnish)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter and one tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat in a large pan. Once the butter has melted, add the chopped garlic to the melted butter & oil, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until you see the garlic has turned light brown. TAKE CARE TO NOT BURN THE GARLIC!</li>
                    <li>Remove the garlic sauce from the pan and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the flour, paprika, salt, and black pepper in a large resealable bag. Add the shrimp to the bag and coat the shrimp with the flour mixture. Make sure all the shrimp is coated evenly. Set the shrimp aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the second tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Once heated, add your shrimp to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook the shrimp over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. You may need to cook the shrimp in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
                    <li>Once you have cooked the last batch of shrimp, add all the shrimp back to the pan and pour over the garlic sauce. Stir to combine and garnish with parsley.</li>
                    <li>Serve Hawaiian Style with sticky white rice and macaroni salad!</li>
                </ol>
